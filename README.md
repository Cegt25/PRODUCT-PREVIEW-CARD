### What I learned

In this project I have learned a little more about responsive design, position elements in the layout, CSS media queries, among other things.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
<div class="description__btns">
   <button type="submit" class="description__btn"><img src="./images/icon-cart.svg" alt="Cart" class="btn__ico">Add to Cart</button>
</div>

description__btns {
  width: 98%;
}

.description__btn {
  width: 100%;
  border: none;
  padding: 1.4rem;
  font-family: Montserrat;
  background-color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 1rem;
  font-size: 1.4rem;
  font-weight: 600;
}

.btn__ico {
  width: 18px;
  height: 18px;
  margin-right: 1rem;
}
```
